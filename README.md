# Heritage

## Language used in completing the project:

1. I have used mainly HTML and CSS for styling the pages. 
2. For functionality I have used JavaScript. 
3. For server side handing i have used php. 
4. For searching i have added ajax inside the js and jquery fade animation for showing search details.

## Process
I have downloaded all the assets at first and later on i have used them inside the code. There are two seperate folders for pictures and vector svg type icons.

## Note:
1. In my first commit i have completed the task using the given figma measurement. Figma measurement doesn't cover the entire screen. That's why I changed the contents width to full.
